# HoVer-Net: Simultaneous Segmentation and Classification of Nuclei in Multi-Tissue Histology Images

A multiple branch network that performs nuclear instance segmentation and classification within a single network. The network leverages the horizontal and vertical distances of nuclear pixels to their centres of mass to separate clustered cells. A dedicated up-sampling branch is used to classify the nuclear type for each segmented instance. <br />

This is an extended version of our previous work: XY-Net.  <br />

**NEWS:** We have now released an inference version of HoVer-Net with WSI-processing capability trained on ~200,000 nuclei. For further information, click [here](https://github.com/simongraham/hovernet_inference).

## Set Up Environment

```
conda create --name hovernet python=3.6
conda activate hovernet
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

Download the CoNSeP dataset as used in our paper from [this link](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/tia/data/hovernet/). <br />
Download the Kumar, CPM-15, CPM-17 and TNBC datsets from [this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1l55cv3DuY-f7-JotDN7N5nbNnjbLWchK).  <br />

Ground truth files are in `.mat` format, refer to the README included with the datasets for further information. 

## Repository Structure

- `src/` contains executable files used to run the model. Further information on running the code can be found in the corresponding directory.
- `loader/`contains scripts for data loading and self implemented augmentation functions.
- `metrics/`contains evaluation code. 
- `misc/`contains util scripts. 
- `model/` contains scripts that define the architecture of the segmentation models. 
- `opt/` contains scripts that define the model hyperparameters. 
- `postproc/` contains post processing utils. 
- `config.py` is the configuration file. Paths need to be changed accordingly.
- `train.py` and `infer.py` are the training and inference scripts respectively.
- `process.py` is the post processing script for obtaining the final instances. 
- `extract_patches.py` is the patch extraction script.
