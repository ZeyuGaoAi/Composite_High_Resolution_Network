# Nuclei Grading of Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma in Histopathological Image by Composite High-Resolution Network

![](framework_grading.png)

A Composite High-Resolution Network for ccRCC nuclei grading. 

The network has two parts:
- Propose a segmentation network called W-Net that can separate the clustered nuclei.
- Recast the fine-grained classification of nuclei to two cross-category classification tasks, based on two high-resolution feature extractors (HRFEs) which are proposed for learning these two tasks. 

The two HRFEs share the same backbone encoder with W-Net by a composite connection so that meaningful features for the segmentation task can be inherited for the classification task. Finally, a head-fusion block is applied to generate the predicted label of each nucleus.
